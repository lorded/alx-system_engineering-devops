0-OSI_model

Description:
This file introduces the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model, an abstract model describing layered communication and computer network design. The OSI model is organized from the lowest level (physical layer) to the highest level (application layer), offering a conceptual framework to understand communication functions in networking. The focus in this project is on the Transport layer (TCP/UDP) and the Network layer (IP and ICMP).
1-types_of_network

Description:
This file explores different types of networks, distinguishing between LAN (Local Area Network) connecting local devices, WAN (Wide Area Network) connecting LANs, and the Internet as a global WAN. The questions address the types of networks that a local computer, offices in different buildings, and a smartphone use when browsing without Wi-Fi.
2-MAC_and_IP_address

Description:
This file delves into MAC (Media Access Control) and IP (Internet Protocol) addresses. It clarifies that a MAC address is the unique identifier of a network interface, while an IP address serves as a device identifier on a network.
3-UDP_and_TCP

Description:
The file discusses UDP (User Datagram Protocol) and TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) within the OSI model. It contains a diagram with missing information about the characteristics of TCP and UDP, asking questions related to their properties and the role of the TCP worker.
4-TCP_and_UDP_ports

Description:
This file introduces TCP and UDP ports, comparing them to windows and doors in a house. It emphasizes the importance of ports in network communication and provides a Bash script to display listening ports, showing the PID and program names associated with each socket.
5-is_the_host_on_the_network

Description:
The file focuses on ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) and its role in checking the availability of network devices using the ping command. It provides a Bash script that accepts an IP address as an argument, pinging the specified address five times and displaying the round-trip time for each attempt.
